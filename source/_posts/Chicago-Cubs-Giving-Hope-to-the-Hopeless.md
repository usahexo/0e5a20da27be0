#  Chicago Cubs Giving Hope to the Hopeless

This year, the Chicago Cubs have given their fans something to cheer about. They are in first place in their division and seem to be heading to the playoffs.

People who are not from Chicago may not know much about the Cubs, so here is a quick summary. The team was founded in 1876 and is one of the oldest professional sports teams in America. They are also one of the most successful teams in baseball, having won two World Series championships. However, they have not won a championship since 1908, which is the longest championship drought in professional sports.

For many years, the Cubs were considered to be a “cursed” team. There were several occasions when they were close to winning a championship, but something always went wrong. This led many fans to believe that they would never win another championship.

However, this year seems to be different. The Cubs are playing well and appear to be headed for the playoffs. This has given their fans hope that they might finally win another championship.

#  Underdog Cubs Surge Into Playoffs

The Cubs were long-shots to make the playoffs this year. Many pundits had them picked to finish near the bottom of the division. But they surged in the second half of the season and clinched a playoff berth on the last day of the season.

The Cubs' improbable playoff run began with a wild card game against the Pittsburgh Pirates. They won that game 5-3, thanks in part to a home run by Javier Baez.

Next up was the NLCS against the St. Louis Cardinals. The Cardinals were heavily favored, but the Cubs managed to pull off an upset and win that series 4-2.

Finally, they reached the World Series, where they faced off against another dynasty team, the Cleveland Indians. The Cubs were once again underdogs, but they managed to pull off another upset and win their first World Series championship in 108 years.

It was a miraculous run for the Cubs, and their fans will never forget it.

#  October Baseball Awaits the Cubs

The National League Divisional Series (NLDS) between the defending champion Chicago Cubs and the Washington Nationals is finally set to begin on Friday, October 6th at Nationals Park in Washington D.C. This series should be a great one, as both teams are evenly matched.

The Cubs had a great season all around and finished with the best record in baseball (92-70). They were led by MVP candidate Kris Bryant and NL Cy Young candidate Kyle Hendricks. The Nationals also had a good season, finishing with an 88-74 record. Their lineup is headlined by Bryce Harper and Daniel Murphy.

This will be the fourth playoff meeting between these two teams, with the Cubs winning two of the previous three matchups. The last time they faced each other was in the 2015 NLDS, when the Cubs defeated the Nationals 3-2 en route to their first World Series victory in 108 years.

The Cubs are certainly hoping for a repeat performance this year. However, they know that it won’t be easy, as they will be facing a very tough Nationals team. This series is sure to be exciting, so make sure to tune in!

#  Cubs Fans Ready for Another Chance at a Championship

The Chicago Cubs are off to a great start in the 2017 season. Many fans believe that this could be the year that they finally win the World Series.

The Cubs started the season with a bang, winning their first six games. They currently have a record of 10-6, which is good enough for second place in the NL Central Division.

There are many reasons to be bullish on the Cubs this season. One of the biggest reasons is their lineup. Kris Bryant, Anthony Rizzo, and Addison Russell are all having great seasons so far.

In addition to their potent lineup, the Cubs also have one of the best pitching staffs in baseball. Jon Lester, Jake Arrieta, and Kyle Hendricks are all capable of leading the team to a championship.

One thing that could potentially hold the Cubs back is their bullpen. The bullpen has been shaky so far this season, and could be a weakness for the team down the stretch.

Despite this potential problem, most fans are confident that the Cubs will win it all this year. There is a lot of excitement surrounding the team, and they appear poised to make a run at another championship.

#  This Could be the Year Chicago Cubs Win it All!

The Cubbies are on a roll and many baseball pundits are saying this could be the year they win it all!

Led by MVP candidate Kris Bryant and Cy Young contender Jake Arrieta, the Cubs have one of the most talented rosters in baseball.

But can they overcome their playoff demons and finally win a World Series?

It won't be easy, but the Cubs have as good a chance as any team to win it all this year.

Here are five reasons why the Chicago Cubs will win the World Series in 2016:

1. The Best Roster in Baseball: The Cubs have one of the best rosters in baseball, with star players like Kris Bryant, Jake Arrieta, Anthony Rizzo, Javier Baez and Addison Russell. This is arguably the most talented roster in Cubs history, and they are poised to make a deep run in the playoffs.

2. Improved Pitching: The Cubs' pitching staff has improved dramatically in recent years, thanks to talented starters like Jake Arrieta and Jon Lester. The bullpen is also solid, with Aroldis Chapman and Hector Rondon leading the way. If the pitching can continue to perform at a high level, the Cubs will be tough to beat.

3. Strong Team Chemistry: The Cubs have great team chemistry, which is rare for a teams that has so much talent. Players like Kris Bryant and Anthony Rizzo are unselfish and seem to enjoy playing together. This could be key factor if they make a run at the World Series.

4. Experience Matters: The Cubs have experience playing in big games, which could help them in the playoffs. They also have plenty of veterans who know how to win championships (e.g., Ben Zobrist, Jason Heyward). This could be an important advantage over young teams like the Dodgers or Astros.

5. They're Hot Right Now: The Cubs are hot right now, winning 18 of their last 23 games heading into September. They seem poised to make a run at the playoffs, and they'll be difficult to beat if they get hot again in October.
