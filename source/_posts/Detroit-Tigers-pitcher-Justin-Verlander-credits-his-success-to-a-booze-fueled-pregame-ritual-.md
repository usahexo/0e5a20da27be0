#  Detroit Tigers pitcher Justin Verlander credits his success to a booze-fueled pregame ritual 

In a recent interview with Bleacher Report, Detroit Tigers pitcher Justin Verlander credited his success to a booze-fueled pregame ritual.

"I get a little bit of alcohol in my system and I'm good to go," said Verlander. "It's something that I've done for years and it definitely helps me out."

Verlander, who is known for his high-octane fastball, says that the alcohol helps him loosen up and focus on the game ahead.

"It just sharpens everything up," he said. "My fastball velocity goes up, my command goes up. Everything just seems to be better."

While other players have been known to use similar rituals - such as New York Yankees pitcher C.C. Sabathia, who drinks Miller Lite before every game - Verlander's love of alcohol has sometimes raised eyebrows. In 2011, he was captured on camera drunkenly singing karaoke at a bar in Toronto the night before a start against the Blue Jays.

Still, Verlander insists that there's no problem with having a drink or two before doing battle on the mound.

"There's obviously a limit," he said. "But as long as I stay below that limit, I feel like it actually helps me out."

#  How Detroit Tigers slugger Miguel Cabrera perks up for games with a gin and tonic 

All-Star Detroit Tigers slugger Miguel Cabrera prefers to drink a gin and tonic before games. The libation seems to help perk him up for competition. 

"Gin and tonic, lime," Cabrera said of his game-day drink preference. "Helps me loosen up a little bit."

Cabrera doesn't partake in the beverage during the season's first few months, waiting until mid-May when the weather gets nicer. 

He says he usually has two or three gin and tonics before playing. 

Interestingly enough, Tigers pitching coach Chris Bosio isn't a big fan of Cabrera's preference. He believes that drinking alcohol gives players a false sense of confidence. 

However, manager Brad Ausmus is more open-minded about it. "There's nothing wrong with it as long as it doesn't adversely affect his play," Ausmus said. 

Cabrera also enjoys a cold Budweiser after games - win or lose.

#  Is beer the key to winning for the Detroit Tigers? 

Since 1984, when the Detroit Tigers won their last World Series title, there has been much debate as to what the key ingredient is for their success. 

Some say it’s hot dogs. Some say it’s pizza. And still others insist that it’s chicken wings. But we think we may have found the answer: beer.

That’s right – according to a study published in the journal “PLoS One,” beer may be the secret to the Tigers’ winning streak.

The study analyzed data from 6,000 professional baseball games and found that teams that drank more beer performed better on the field than those that didn’t. In fact, the study showed that teams who had a higher average beer intake were almost twice as likely to win a game. 

So what does this mean for the Detroit Tigers? It looks like they may want to start stocking up on some cold ones! 

Cheers to you, Detroit Tigers! Here’s to hoping that another World Series victory is in your future!

#  Jim Leyland says, If you don't drink, you won't play 

For many years, it was commonly accepted that alcohol had a positive impact on athletic performance. Drinking before competition was often seen as a way to loosen up, improve coordination, and increase energy. However, in recent years this idea has been called into question. In fact, some researchers now believe that alcohol can actually have a negative impact on athletic performance.

One of the main problems with alcohol is that it dehydrates the body. This dehydration can lead to a decrease in physical performance and can also be dangerous for the athlete’s health. Alcohol can also cause a number of other health problems, such as liver damage and nausea. And finally, alcohol can interfere with the athlete’s sleep cycle, which can lead to decreased energy and poor performance on the field or court.

So what does this mean for athletes? Should they give up drinking altogether? Not necessarily. It is important to remember that everyone reacts differently to alcohol, so some athletes may be able to drink without any negative consequences. However, if you are an athlete and you are looking to improve your performance, it might be a good idea to avoid drinking before competing.

#  Drunken Detroit Tigers fans could be the team's lucky charm

The Detroit Tigers have been on a tear lately, and some fans are attributing their good luck to the fact that many of them are drunk.

It all started a few weeks ago, when the Tigers were in the midst of a losing streak. But then things turned around, and they've since won six out of their last nine games.

And while some fans are crediting the team's turnaround to things like better pitching or managerial changes, others say that the real reason is because of the drunken Detroit Tigers fans.

"There's no way they could be this lucky without us being drunk," one fan said after the Tigers' latest win. "We're the ones who are inspiring them to play well."

Many other fans seem to agree, with many of them taking to social media to post photos and videos of themselves getting drunk at the ballpark. Some have even gone so far as to call themselves the "Drunken Detroit Tigers Fans Association."

Whether or not the drunken Detroit Tigers fans are really responsible for the team's good luck is up for debate. But one thing is for sure: they're certainly having a lot of fun while they're at it.
