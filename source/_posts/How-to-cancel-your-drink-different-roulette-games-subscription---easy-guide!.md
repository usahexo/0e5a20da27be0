Once you know the cancellation policy, it's time to start unsubscribing. This can usually be done through your account settings or by emailing the customer service team. Again, make sure you do this within the timeframe outlined in the cancellation policy - or you could be charged for another month of service.

If all else fails, contact your bank or credit card company and dispute the charges. This is often a last resort, but it can help get your money back if you feel like you've been wrongfully charged by the drink different roulette games company.
