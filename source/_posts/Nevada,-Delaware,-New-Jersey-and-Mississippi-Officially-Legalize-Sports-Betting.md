#  Nevada, Delaware, New Jersey and Mississippi Officially Legalize Sports Betting

It’s been a long time coming, but sports betting is now officially legal in four U.S. states. Nevada was the first state to legalize sports betting way back in 1949, but Delaware, New Jersey and Mississippi have now followed suit.

This is great news for the gambling industry, as well as for fans of sports betting who have been eager to get their hands on some legal action. There is no doubt that this move will help to boost the economy in these states, and it will also create new jobs in the gambling industry.

It’s still unclear how this will all play out in terms of regulation and taxation, but there is no doubt that there will be plenty of money to be made in the coming years. Sports betting has always been a huge industry, and it looks like things are only going to get bigger from here on out.

For those who are interested in getting in on the action, there are plenty of online casinos where you can bet on your favourite sports teams. Be sure to do your research before you start placing any bets though, as not all casinos are created equal.

It will be interesting to see how the four newly legalized states handle sports betting, and whether or not more states will follow their lead in the near future. In any case, it’s clear that things are about to get a lot more interesting in the world of online gambling!

#  Professional Sports Leagues largely on Board with Sports Betting legalization

Professional sports leagues from the NBA to MLB have largely come out in support of legalized sports betting, a shift from their long-held opposition to it.

In a statement issued Wednesday, the NBA said that it “believes that sports betting should be legalized and regulated.” The statement went on to say that the league believes legalized betting would protect the integrity of its games while providing a new revenue stream.

The NBA’s position is a notable change from its previous stance on sports betting. In 1992, then-NBA commissioner David Stern testified before Congress that he was against legalized sports betting “because it would lead to game fixing.”

In a conference call with reporters Wednesday, MLB commissioner Rob Manfred said that his league also supports legalization and regulation of sports betting.

“The important thing for us is that there be realities in place that protect the integrity of our sport,” Manfred said.

Both leagues join the NHL, which has supported legalization of sports betting for years, as well as the NFL, which has softened its stance in recent months. In May, NFL commissioner Roger Goodell said that his league was open to legalizing gambling on football but would only do so if there was “an appropriate regulatory framework.”

The growing support for legalized sports betting among America’s professional sports leagues likely has to do with two factors: mounting pressure from states seeking to legalize gambling and the growing popularity of fantasy sports.

While the NBA and MLB have long been opposed to gambling on their games, they have realized that they can no longer ignore the potential financial windfall offered by legalized sports betting. A study commissioned by the American Gaming Association (AGA) last year found that legalizing and regulating sports betting could generate up to $25 billion in annual revenue nationwide.

#  NBA Oddsmaker: Legalized sports betting won't have a huge impact on the league

As the U.S. Supreme Court prepares to rule on a case that could legalize sports betting nationwide, estimates on how much money is bet illegally annually vary from $150 billion to $400 billion. But even if the high end of that estimate is accurate, that would only amount to a sliver of overall sports spending in the United States.

And that doesn't take into account that a good chunk of the illegal betting is on amateur and international sports, not major pro leagues like the NBA.

"Our view is it's not going to have a huge impact on the NBA," said Jeff Sherman, vice president and assistant general manager at the Las Vegas Superbook. "There's so much interest in watching games and betting them anyway, whether it's legal or not."

The NBA has been monitoring the situation and has already contingency plans in place, but it's still unclear what shape legalized sports betting will take if it is approved by the Supreme Court.

"We're hopeful that whatever happens provides a level playing field for all stakeholders - fans, teams, leagues and others - and allows us to protect our intellectual property and monitor play for potential fraud and abuse," NBA spokesman Mike Bass said in an email statement.

#  Rhode Island becomes the 5th state to legalize sports betting

Rhode Island Governor Gina Raimondo signed a bill into law on Thursday that allows the state to offer sports betting.

This makes Rhode Island the 5th state in the US to legalize sports betting, following Nevada, Delaware, New Jersey and West Virginia.

The state is expected to begin offering sports betting within the next few weeks. The new law allows for both in-person and online sports betting.

Rhode Island is expected to take in between $3 million and $10 million in annual revenue from sports betting.

#  Connecticut lawmakers consider legalizing sports betting

#

Last month, the U.S. Supreme Court overturned a federal ban on sports gambling, opening the door for states to legalize and regulate the activity. Now, lawmakers in Connecticut are considering taking advantage of this opportunity.

#

Proponents of legalizing sports betting argue that it would bring much-needed revenue to the state. They point out that other forms of gambling are already legal in Connecticut, so it makes sense to allow sports betting as well.

#

Opponents of legalization argue that it could lead to addiction and other social ills. They also worry that it could damage the integrity of sporting events.

#

Regardless of where you stand on the issue, it is likely that Connecticut will soon legalize sports betting. The state stands to gain a great deal from this move, while opponents have failed to make a strong case against it.
