#  People which hate Cosmic Gems Game accuse it of gambling addiction

There is a big discussion on the web these days about the new game called Cosmic Gems. Some people love it, some people hate it and accuse it of gambling addiction. Let's see what is this all about.

The basic idea of the game is to match gems of the same color to make them disappear. When you make a match, the gems fall down and disappear, and new gems come up from the bottom of the screen to take their place. If you get 4 or more gems of the same color in a row, they will create a power gem which can clear out an entire row or column when matched.

The game has been described as 'addictive' by many players, partly because it is so easy to start playing and yet hard to stop. You can easily get sucked into playing for hours on end trying to get just one more level completed or beat your high score.

Some people have criticised Cosmic Gems for being a 'gambling addiction' because of this addictive quality. They say that it's designed to keep you playing for as long as possible so that the developers can make more money from you. Whether or not this is true, it's certainly true that some people have become addicted to gaming in general and Cosmic Gems in particular.

So what do you think? Is Cosmic Gems a harmless bit of fun, or is it something to be wary of?

#  People which hate Cosmic Gems Game claim It's a scam!

It's no secret that many people who have played Cosmic Gems Game, either on their browsers or mobile devices, feel that the game is nothing more than a scam. And in some ways, these individuals may be correct.

First and foremost, the game is extremely difficult to win unless players spend real money on in-game bonuses. Secondly, Cosmic Gems Game appears to be heavily rigged in favor of the house - meaning that it is easy for the casino to make money at the expense of players. Finally, customer service is often unresponsive or downright hostile to players who have questions or concerns about their accounts.

Put simply, it's easy to see why some people might call Cosmic Gems Game a scam. However, does this mean that the game is actually dishonest? Not necessarily. After all, any casino game (or any other form of gambling) is designed to give the house an edge. That's how casinos make money - by taking a percentage of each pot.

In addition, just because the customer service for Cosmic Gems Game is often unhelpful doesn't mean that they are doing anything wrong. It's possible that the company simply doesn't have enough staff to handle all of the inquiries they receive. And finally, just because the game is difficult to win without spending money doesn't mean that it's impossible to do so. There are plenty of successful players who have never spent a penny on in-game bonuses.

So is Cosmic Gems Game a scam? In our opinion, no - though we understand why some people might think that it is. Ultimately, whether or not you choose to play this game is up to you - but we recommend doing your own research before making a decision.

Cosmic Gems is a challenging and highly addictive mobile game that has quickly become a fan favorite. Though some people seem to think that the game is rigged, nothing could be further from the truth! It simply takes a lot of practice to get good at it.

The object of the game is to line up three or more gems of the same color either horizontally or vertically. When you make a match, those gems disappear and new ones fall from the top of the screen to take their place. If the gems reach the top, the game is over.

While there are only a few basic rules, mastering Cosmic Gems takes time and patience. In order to get better at the game, you need to learn how to properly plan your moves and figure out which combos will give you the best results.

Don't let anyone tell you that Cosmic Gems is rigged - it's simply a challenging and rewarding game that takes some practice to master!

#  People which hate Cosmic Gems Game believe that it's designed to steal your money!

I have never played the Cosmic Gems Game, but I have heard a lot of people talking about it on social media. From what I’ve been able to gather, some people seem to hate it, while others enjoy it. After doing a bit of research, I found that the people who hate the game believe that it is designed to steal your money!

They argue that the game is rigged in such a way that it is nearly impossible to win, and that the developers only make money by taking advantage of players who lose their money. While I cannot confirm or deny these allegations, I can say that they make a valid point.

It is certainly possible for games like this to be designed in a way that makes it difficult for players to win and encourages them to spend more money in order to improve their chances. This may not be intentional on the part of the developers, but it can still happen.

Therefore, if you are thinking about playing the Cosmic Gems Game, or any other similar game, you should be aware of the risks involved. Make sure you are comfortable with the possibility of losing your money, and don’t spend more than you can afford to lose.
