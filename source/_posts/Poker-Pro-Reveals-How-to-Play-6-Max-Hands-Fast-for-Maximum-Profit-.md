#  Poker Pro Reveals How to Play 6 Max Hands Fast for Maximum Profit 

Playing poker is a great way to make some extra cash on the side, or even as a full time career. But it can be tricky to know exactly how to play each hand for maximum profit. Especially when playing in a 6 max game.

In this article, we'll look at one professional poker player's strategy for playing 6 max hands quickly and profitably.

The first thing to remember is that you always want to be aggressive in 6 max games. This means betting and raising as much as possible, in order to take down the pots with the best hands and scare your opponents out of good hands with weaker ones.

When it comes to specific hands, there are a few things to keep in mind. For example, when you're dealt Ace-King (A-K), you should usually raise preflop regardless of what the other players are doing. This is because A-K is such a strong hand and has a lot of potential for winning big pots.

Another important thing to remember when playing 6 max is that position is key. You want to be in as many pots as possible when you have the best hand, and get out of as many pots as possible when you don't. This means being aggressive early in the game when you have good cards, and playing more passively as the stakes get higher and there are more players left in the hand.

By following these tips, you can improve your chances of winning big money in 6 max poker games!

#  How to Play 6 Max Poker Hands in Just 60 Minutes Per Hour 

Playing poker is a game that takes time to learn and get good at. Many people play for hours on end in an attempt to improve their game. But what if you could play better by only spending 60 minutes per hour? Believe it or not, this is entirely possible by following a few simple tips.

Tip 1: Play fewer hands per hour
The first tip is to simply play fewer hands per hour. This may sound like common sense, but there’s a reason why many players try to play as many hands as possible. It’s because they think that the more hands they play, the more likely they are to win money. However, this isn’t actually true. In fact, playing more hands can often lead to worse results since you’re not giving yourself enough time to make good decisions. By playing fewer hands, you can focus on making the best possible plays and increase your chances of winning.

Tip 2: Choose your hands carefully
The second tip is to choose your hands carefully. Not all hands are created equal, and some are much better than others. In order to win at poker, you need to be playing the best hands as often as possible. So how do you determine which hands are the best? There are a few factors you need to consider including position, stack size, and opponent tendencies. By taking all of these things into account, you can narrow down your hand selection and increase your chances of winning.

Tip 3: Stay patient 
The third tip is to stay patient. One of the biggest mistakes new players make is trying to do too much too soon. They see a card they like and decide to raise without really thinking about the consequences. While this may work in some situations, it’s usually not the best strategy. Instead, you should take your time and wait for the right opportunity before making a move. This may mean letting some weaker hands go, but it will be worth it in the long run.

Tip 4: Use aggression wisely 
The fourth tip is to use aggression wisely. Many players make the mistake of using aggression when it’s not necessary. This can lead to costly mistakes and reduced profits over time. Instead, you should use aggression when it’s most effective – namely when you have a strong hand or when you know your opponent is weak. By using aggression in the right situations, you can take control of the game and increase your chances of winning.

Tip 5: Know your opponents 
The fifth tip is to know your opponents. This may sound difficult, but it can actually be quite easy if you take the time to study them carefully. By knowing what kind of player each opponent is, you can adjust your strategy accordingly and give yourself an edge over them at all times. For example, if you know that one opponent likes to bluff a lot, you can call their bluffs more often than not and win big pots uncontested!

Tip 6: Practice makes perfect 
Finally, the last tip is simply to practice as much as possible! The more you play poker, the better you will become at it – there’s no doubt about that! So find some friends or online opponents and start practicing today!

#  Playing 6 Max Poker: How Many Hands per Hour Should You Average? 

You may be wondering how many hands per hour you should average when playing 6 max poker. The answer to this question largely depends on the level of poker you are playing and your own personal playing style. However, as a general guideline, you should aim to play around 50-60 hands per hour when playing at a lower level and up to 100 hands per hour when playing at a higher level.

When playing 6 max poker it is important to be selective with the hands that you choose to play. This is because there is less room for error when playing at this table size. In addition, since there are more players in the pot, the odds of winning the hand are reduced. Therefore, it is important to only play premium hands and avoid marginal hands altogether.

By playing fewer hands per hour, you will be able to focus more on the quality of your hands and make sure that you are making the most profitable plays possible. Additionally, this will also help to reduce the amount of variance that you experience while playing poker.

#  Get Up to Speed in 6 Max Poker - Learn How Many Hands to Play Per Hour 

Poker is a game that is constantly evolving. The advent of online poker and the ability to play against other people from around the world has made the game more complex than ever. 

There are a number of variants of poker, but the most popular by far is Texas Hold’em. In this article, we will focus on how to play Max Poker so that you can get up to speed as quickly as possible. 

Max Poker is a variant of Texas Hold’em that is becoming increasingly popular. The basic premise is that each player is dealt a maximum of six cards, and they must use all six cards to make their best five-card hand. 

The advantage of Max Poker is that it moves much more quickly than traditional Texas Hold’em, and it is perfect for players who want to get in lots of hands per hour. 

In order to play Max Poker effectively, you need to understand three key concepts: starting hands, bet sizing, and position. 

Starting Hands 

As in traditional Texas Hold’em, your starting hands are important in Max Poker. In general, you will want to stick with hands that have at least two pairs or better. Some good starting hands include: A-A-K-Q-J (a straight), 3-3-4-5-6 (a triplet), 2-2-3-4-5 (a pair and two singles), and K-10-9-8-7 (a high kicker). 

You should also be aware of which hands are bad starting hands. Some poor starting hands include: A♦-2♥ (a low pair), 5♣-4♠ (two connected cards), and J♣-9♥ (one high card). 

Bet Sizing 

In Max Poker, you should generally bet in proportion to the size of the pot. For example, if there is already $10 in the pot and you hold a hand like K♣-J♠, you would bet around $1-$2 since your hand has showdown value. 

If there is a lot of money in the pot (e.g., $100), then you would bet a larger amount ($10-$20) since you want your opponent to fold as much as possible. Conversely, if there is very little money in the pot ($2), then you would only bet a small amount ($0.50-$1). 


Position 
Position is very important in Max Poker because it allows you to see what your opponents are holding before you have to act. In general, you want to be on the button or in late position when playing Max Poker so that you can see what everyone else has before betting. 

Now that you understand these three key concepts, let’s take a look at an example hand from a real game: 

You are sitting in midposition with J♦-10♦ and the flop comes J♥-9♥-8♦ (giving you two pair). The player on your left bets $5 into the $10 pot, so it now has $15 in it after their raise. You should reraise allin here with your two pair because there are no draws out there anymore and it's very likely one of your opponents has trips or quads at this point..
