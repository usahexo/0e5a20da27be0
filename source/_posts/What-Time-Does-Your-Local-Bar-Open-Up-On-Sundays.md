#  What Time Does Your Local Bar Open Up On Sundays?

It's no secret that some bars are open on Sundays, but what time do they actually open up? Depending on your location, the hours may vary.

Generally, most bars will open at 11am or 12pm and stay open until around 2am or 3am. There are some exceptions, of course. If there's a major sporting event taking place that day (like the Super Bowl), many bars will extend their hours to cater to the fans. 

If you're looking for a place to drink on a Sunday, it's best to do a little bit of research first and see which establishments will be open. Keep in mind that not every bar will be opened, so it's always best to call ahead and make sure.

Racetracks are also popular in Oklahoma.
