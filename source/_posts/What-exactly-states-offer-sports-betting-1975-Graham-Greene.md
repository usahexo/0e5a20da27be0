#  What exactly states offer sports betting 1975 Graham Greene?

In his book about gambling, "The Casino Royal," Graham Greene addresses a variety of questions about casinos and betting. One question he tackles is what states offer sports betting.

At the time Greene was writing, only Nevada offered sports betting. However, other states have since legalized the activity, including Delaware, Montana, Oregon, and West Virginia. In most cases, sports betting is limited to in-person wagers at casinos or racetracks; online betting is not generally allowed.

Nevada has long been the king of gambling in the United States. The state was one of the first to legalize casino gaming, and it continues to be a hotspot for gambling today. In addition to sports betting, Nevada offers a variety of other casino games, as well as bingo and poker tournaments.

Delaware was the second state to legalize sports betting, doing so in 2009. The state's three casinos offer a range of sports betting options, including live and online betting. Delaware also allows parlay bets - multiple bets on multiple games - which are not typically allowed in other states.

Montana was the third state to legalize sports betting in 2011. The law allows casinos and race tracks to offer wagers on most professional and college sporting events. However, Sportsbettinglawyer notes that the law is not particularly user-friendly, as it is difficult for bettors to find information about where they can place bets.

Oregon followed suit in 2013, with its Sports Action law allowing residents to make in-person wagers on NFL games at tribal casinos. Like Montana's law, Oregon's Sports Action is not especially well-known among bettors and can be difficult to navigate without help from a casino employee or gambler friend.

West Virginia became the latest state to legalize sports betting when its legislature passed a bill in March 2018 allowing both land-based and online bets. The bill had strong bipartisan support and was seen as a way for West Virginia to capitalize on the growing popularity of legal gambling across the country

The intricacies of state-based sports betting were detailed by Graham Greene in a 1975 article for The New York Times. With the advent of legal sports betting in some states, Greene's piece is more relevant than ever.

Greene explained that, because of the variety of state laws governing sports betting, there was no simple way to place a bet. In some states, you could only bet on collegiate games; in others, only professional contests were available. And while some states allowed betting on any game, others had restrictions on the types of bets that could be placed.

There were also differences in how the betting was done. Some states used pari-mutuel systems, in which the odds were set by the house but changed depending on how much money was wagered on each team. Other states used fixed odds, where the odds for each game were set before the contest began and did not change.

This complexity resulted in a thriving black market for sports betting. Greene estimated that Americans were spending $2 billion per year illegally on sports bets - more than they spent on either horses or dogs.

With legalized sports betting now available in several states, it will be interesting to see if this black market disappears or simply shifts to new venues. Whatever happens, it's clear that Graham Greene's insightful article from 1975 provides a valuable perspective on this complex and evolving area of law
