#  When Will the Federal Government Finally Legalize Online Gambling?

Online gambling is a $40 billion industry and it is only legal in three states. Many people believe that the federal government will legalize online gambling in the near future, but there is no clear indication that this will happen.

The main reason that the federal government has not legalized online gambling is because there are concerns about how it will be regulated. There are also concerns about how online gambling will impact state governments that already have gambling laws in place.

Some people believe that the federal government will legalize online gambling in order to help to combat illegal gambling operations. However, there are also concerns that legalizing online gambling could lead to an increase in addiction rates.

There is no clear indication as to when or if the federal government will legalize online gambling. In the meantime, individual states are free to legalize online gambling if they choose to do so.

#  States Poised to Legalize Online Gambling If Feds Don't Act

A number of states are in the process of legalizing online gambling, even as the federal government seems poised to take a hands-off approach.

The first state to legalize online gambling was Nevada, in 2013. New Jersey followed suit in 2014, and Delaware legalized it in 2015. West Virginia is on track to become the fourth state to do so, with a bill that passed the state House of Delegates last month and is now being considered by the Senate.

Pennsylvania could be next in line; its Senate has passed a bill legalizing online gambling, and the House is expected to take it up this fall. Other states that are considering legalizing online gambling include Michigan, Illinois and California.

If these states go ahead with their plans, it would mark a big change in how Americans gamble. Online gambling is currently illegal under federal law, but the Justice Department has long taken a hands-off approach to regulating it. In 2011, the department issued a memo stating that it would not prosecute operators who complied with state laws legalizing online gambling.

That policy appears to be changing under President Donald Trump. In January, new Attorney General Jeff Sessions sent a letter to Congress saying that he would revisiting the department's stance on online gambling. The potential for a crackdown has led some casino companies to back away from plans to expand into online gambling.

But for states that have already legalized it, the Trump administration's stance doesn't seem to be causing much concern. "We're moving ahead because we feel comfortable that we're operating within what we understand to be DOJ policy," said Delaware Lottery Director Vernon Kirk in an interview with Reuters.

So far, there hasn't been any movement on bills legalizing online gambling at the federal level. But if more states go ahead with their plans, it's likely that Congress will take up the issue.

#  It's Time for Congress to legalize online gambling

It's no secret that the $240 billion global gambling industry is a massive moneymaker. Online gambling in particular is on the rise, with estimates that it will bring in over $52 billion by 2020. So why is it that this growing industry is still illegal in the United States?

The answer, of course, lies in politics. Gambling interests have long been a powerful force in Washington, and they've used their influence to keep online gambling illegal. But times are changing, and with technological advances making online gambling more accessible than ever, the tide is starting to turn.

More and more Americans are beginning to see the benefits of legalizing online gambling. It would generate much-needed revenue for state and federal governments, create jobs, and support local businesses. And it would give millions of Americans access to a safe and fun form of entertainment.

So why isn't Congress taking action? One reason may be the opposition of powerful casino interests. But as public opinion continues to shift in favor of legalization, it's only a matter of time before Congress acts. The time has come for Congress to legalize online gambling!

#  Nevada Leads The Way In Legalizing Online Gambling

Nevada is leading the way in legalizing online gambling. The state has become the first to pass a law that clears the way for licensed casinos to offer games such as poker, blackjack and slots to customers over the internet.

Governor Brian Sandoval signed the bill into law on Tuesday, saying it would "provide a more open and fair environment" for online gambling and create jobs in the process. The bill had bipartisan support in the legislature, with one Republican senator describing it as a "jobs bill."

It's not yet clear how many jobs will be created by the new law, but it's likely to be in the hundreds. In addition, it's expected to bring in millions of dollars in extra tax revenue for the state.

Online gambling has been growing rapidly in recent years, with revenues estimated at more than $33 billion per year. That's set to grow even further now that Nevada has legalized it, as players will no doubt flock to its casinos from around the world.

The move is also likely to increase pressure on other states to follow suit. California is currently considering a similar bill, and it's only a matter of time before other states also legalize online gambling.

#  Could Sports Betting be Next After Legalization of Online Poker in US?

Online poker was legalized in the US in 2013, and this has given rise to a number of new businesses in the online gaming space. Some experts are now predicting that sports betting could be next on the list, as legislators and policymakers begin to see its potential for generating tax revenue.

At the moment, online sports betting is only legal in a handful of states. However, there is growing momentum for legalization, with more than half of US states now considering bills that would allow it. The potential benefits are clear – not only could it generate much-needed tax revenue, but it could also create thousands of new jobs.

The growth of the industry is already being seen in countries where online sports betting is legal. In the UK, for example, the market is estimated to be worth more than £4 billion per year. And this is just the beginning – as more people become comfortable with using their smartphones and other devices to place bets, the market is expected to grow even further.

If you’re interested in getting involved in the online sports betting industry, there are a number of things you need to know. In this article, we will look at some of the key aspects of this rapidly growing sector.

The first thing you need to understand is that there are two main types of sports betting: fixed odds and parlay betting. In fixed odds betting, you place a bet on a specific outcome (e.g. who will win a particular match). With parlay betting, you bet on two or more outcomes, with your winnings depending on how many bets you get correct.

There are a range of different ways to bet on sports, including head-to-head bets, over/under bets and prop bets. In head-to-head bets, you bet on who will win a match or contest; over/under bets involve predicting whether a particular event will happen over or under a particular number; and prop bets are wagers on obscure outcomes (e.g. which player will score first in an upcoming match).

One thing to keep in mind when placing sports bets is that bookmakers always have an edge – known as the ‘vig’ or ‘juice’. This means that they have calculated how likely each outcome is, and they will offer slightly lower odds on events that they think are more likely to happen. It’s therefore important to do your research before placing any wagers!

Another factor you need to take into account when betting on sports is variance. This term refers to how often results go against expectations – i.e., how often proverbial ‘bad beats’ occur. If you’re betting on an event with low variance (such as a football match), then your chances of winning are relatively high; however, if you’re betting on an event with high variance (such as a horse race), then your chances of winning are lower but the payouts can be much higher.

In order to make money from sports betting, it’s important to adopt a long-term strategy. This means finding good value matches where you believe one side is underestimated by bookmakers, and then making sure you place well-informed bets with accurate analysis backing up your predictions!
