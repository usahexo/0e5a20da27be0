#  Who else owns the Dragon Shard Game?

The Dragon Shard game is a popular mobile game that was created by Ludia Inc. The company has released other popular games such as Jurassic World: The Game and is known for its work on licensed properties. But who else owns the Dragon Shard game?

Ludia Inc. is not the only company that owns the Dragon Shard game. Universal Brand Development, a division of NBCUniversal, also owns the rights to the game. Universal Brand Development is responsible for developing and managing intellectual property for NBCUniversal. This means that they are in charge of creating and marketing products related to movies and TV shows made by NBCUniversal.

So why did Ludia Inc. create the Dragon Shard game? It’s likely because they hold the licensing rights to produce games based on the Jurassic World movie franchise. The Jurassic World movie franchise is owned by Universal Pictures, which is a division of NBCUniversal. This gives Ludia Inc. access to some of the intellectual property owned by Universal Brand Development.

It’s interesting to note that Ludia Inc. isn’t the only company with ties to NBCUniversal. Another company, Gameloft, also has a relationship with the media conglomerate. Gameloft developed an official game for the Olympic Games held in Rio de Janeiro in 2016. NBCUniversal was one of the sponsors of the Olympic Games, so it makes sense that they would partner with Gameloft for an official game.
